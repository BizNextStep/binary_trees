0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Answer
### Binary Tree
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. A binary tree is a special case of a tree data structure where each node has at most two children. 

### Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. 

### Time Complexity
Binary trees can provide faster search, insertion, and deletion operations compared to linked lists. The time complexity of these operations in a binary tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. In contrast, the time complexity of these operations in a linked list is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

### Depth, Height, and Size
The depth of a node in a binary tree is the number of edges from the root node to that node. The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth of any node in the tree. The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes in the tree.

### Traversal Methods
There are three main traversal methods for binary trees: inorder, preorder, and postorder. In inorder traversal, the left subtree is visited first, followed by the root node, and then the right subtree. In preorder traversal, the root node is visited first, followed by the left subtree, and then the right subtree. In postorder traversal, the left subtree is visited first, followed by the right subtree, and then the root node.

### Complete, Full, Perfect, and Balanced Binary Trees
A complete binary tree is a binary tree where all levels except possibly the last level are completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. A full binary tree is a binary tree where every node has either 0 or 2 children. A perfect binary tree is a binary tree where all internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level. A balanced binary tree is a binary tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
